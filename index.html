            <p>I do not write often, I do not like being a public figure, there is often a person who can express your opinion laconic and glorious for you and, of course, it's easier to translate or put a word when you see what you understand and share in your thoughts. However, each of us has its own individual, private and somehow unique experience of its development, life's path and world perception. In this post, I want to share my experience of how to start my life from scratch, or even from a minus.
							Many years ago my family decided to emigrate from Ukraine. I cannot say that we lived poorly in Ukraine, rather, on the contrary, even very good in comparison with many. The decision to emigrate made me accept my husband, whom I am now immensely grateful for this, but now, and before there was a drama, because at that time I did not see and understand things that became clear and natural to me later. Life then seemed pretty, wonderful and cloudless, nobody knew, and few could guess about the catastrophic cataclysms that were waiting for Ukraine in the near future. At that time, I could not imagine an economic decline, poverty, squares, revolution and war was at the verge of madness and nonsense, but time has shown that there is nothing constant and unrealizable in the world, and the understanding of the situation, intuition and experience cost much more than any material value.
						 So, in order. In Ukraine, I was an ordinary young wife, to a certain extent an athlete, an entrepreneur. For myself, I am not crying for migration, but with certain important and controversial issues, taking this as a desire for my husband to change his life and how to say "fashionably" to leave the comfort zone. My husband's ancient dream was life in the USA. The first step towards emigration was the question of learning the language and organizing the trip.
						 The first day in school was a shock to us. Even at the reception, the young girl turned to us in fast English, even though we did not understand 75% of her said. She spoke quickly and confidently, and only later, we realized that by such a principle, "understand, or if you cannot - die, but still understand" and built the whole meaning of learning in school. We studied with people of all ages (from 17 to 50 years old) from all over the world, Cambodia, Mexico, Laos, Japan, Ghana, Somalia, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Iraq, Iran. It was interesting to know the cultures of other peoples, to understand their views on life, national habits and traditions. In addition to studying the language, the scool has given us an understanding of the fact that people all over the earth are the same and seek essentially the same things, and nationality and race, that is, purely conditional, if not, in general an artificial division between us. We also saw new ways and means of learning and communication between students and teachers, where we sometimes changed roles and taught our language teachers. Rather, they were equal partners in trying to understand and learn something new. We were so limited in finances, we could not found work for eight months.
						 Eight months later we moved residents to our own apartment, where and housing until we bought a home. The first year was one day. The USA was a beautiful and extremely interesting country, everything was so "necessary" and not so in Ukraine. But this is some positive experience with my over 25 years of life in Ukraine, my parents, a friend, etc. Although my husband did not argue at all about this mood. Here he felt like a fish in the water from the very first day. Also, I understood that I'm here in the USA and I am nobody, nobody needs me except my husband. It was obvious to me that I am a student and a tourist and leaves money for studies and a student - this is one thing, but how to live here and what to do ??? ... That was a question, and the question is not easyâ€¦
